                    <h3>Leadership</h3>
                    <p>I believe that effective leadership is rooted in the leader's motivation, communication skills,
                    and ability to inspire others. A leader's <u>optimism</u> should serve as a <u>magnet</u> and <u>catalyst</u> for
                    innovation, attracting like-minded individuals who share the same ambition, determination, and
                    discipline.</p>

                  <div style="text-align: justify;"><br>
                   <h3>Passion</h3>
                   <p>My passion lies in understanding global economic trends and their impact on financial markets,
                    as well as exploring areas such as back-end development, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing.
                    I am dedicated to continuously expanding my knowledge and skills in these fields through learning,
                    and as I am actively seeking opportunities to gain practical experience, I am eager to develop
                    proficiency in quantitative analysis, software development, and operations management. Passion is
                   the toughest emotion to control, we feel it in the experiences that our personality enjoys the most,
                   and thus everytime it appears it comes attached with a gigantic responsibility.</p>

                   <h3>Efficiency</h3>
                   <p>Efficiency is a concept well rooted into the human reasoning process. Without it, every already negligent
                     goal that has existed in the history of humanity would be far more inaccurate. Every goal is an efficiency
                   targeted goal, and everyone who has ever argued the contrary is absolutely wrong. The issue at hand is the common
                   definition of 'efficiency.' When used in conversation, it usually refers to production or manufacturing.
                   But in reality, efficiency is involved in every process ever designed by any human being, no matter the goal,
                   target, or dependent/independent variables affected. Whatever the task is, the best solution a human brain is
                   able to find, is solving a process in more goal-oriented efficient way, and therefore satisfying a pre-existing
                     necessity. Economics is the science dedicated to studying how to solve a problem by allocating scarce resources
                   in a more efficient way. I made a choice to invest time studying this science, because I 'understand' the
                   value of someone who truly understands it. The principles that dictate said person's decision making process
                   can be applied to any industry and any task</p>

                  <div style="text-align: justify;"><br>
                    <h3>Control</h3>
                    <p>People tend to say that obsessing over control is a terrible path leading to a <u>troubled mind</u>,
                      and as we live in a <u>chaos system</u>; influenced primarily by the initial conditions of each subset
                      from within the system: <u>the mind cannot comprehend</u>, I agree. However, learning to control
                      one's desire for control and power can make one's emotional intellect grow immensely. This
                      gives birth to a rising current of different 'gains-of-control.' Once we 'understand' breathing as the
                      main source of life, and as main provider of energy to our physical body, we can learn to control
                      our emotions to such point that we gain the capacity to manipulate our perception of how the world
                      that surrounds us affects us. This constant grasp for comprehension results in a product, a combination
                      of will, effort, desire to learn, and patience, an imperative requirement to 'understanding.' Once it exists,
                      it can no longer seize to do so, as once we understand something, our innate human qualities force us to develop
                      unconscious subjective bias. Once we understand a goal in a way, we can't stop doing so,
                      and that's when we are presented with the most important experience of them all. The one that
                      finally determines which path our lives will take and what piece we will play in the
                      horrifyingly beautiful bureaucratic masterpiece humanity has created to power and sustain the
                      survival and evolution of our species: a decision. "Will we give in to the notion of powerlessness,
                      knowing it makes us powerful, and take a strong position, to back our decisions or...
                      will we pass them on and ceed <u>control</u>?"</p><br>
                      <p>And so, a <u>rational consumer</u> is either <u>born</u> or <u>murdered</u>.</p>
